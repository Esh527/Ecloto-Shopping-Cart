Objective:
My task is like building the UI for an E-commerce Listing Page based
on the provided assignment. The page should display a list of products, and
each product should have an option to either view the product or add it to the
cart. There will be no dedicated product page, so when a user clicks "Add to Cart" items should be shown in down.
Simply, it is React application that allows users to add products to a shopping cart, update quantities, and track progress towards earning a free gift.
